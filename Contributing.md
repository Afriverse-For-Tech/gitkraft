## Getting Started

The best way to contribute to ProjectCodex is to become part of our Discord community. Discord serves as our primary communication platform, where you can connect with fellow developers, ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate on projects.

1. Join our Discord server using this invite link: [Discord Invite Link](https://discord.gg/5HYZZyHf).

2. Once you've joined, introduce yourself in the "Introduction" channel. Let others know about your skills and interests.

3. Join or create a team within our Discord community. Teams are groups of contributors working together on specific aspects of the project, such as features, bug fixes, or documentation. You can find existing teams or propose new ones in the "Teams" channel.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Find a Team or Create One

Browse through the available teams on our Discord server to find a project or task that aligns with your interests and skills. If you can't find a suitable team, don't hesitate to propose a new one.

### 2. Get Acquainted

Once you're part of a team, introduce yourself to your team members and discuss the project or task you'll be working on. Communication and collaboration are key.

### 3. Collaborate and Contribute

Collaborate with your team to work on your chosen project or task. Use our Discord channels for real-time discussions and updates.

### 4. Submit Your Work

When your work is ready for review, create a pull request on our GitHub repository. Make sure to follow our [Code Submission Guidelines](code-submission-guidelines.md) when creating your pull request.

### 5. Review and Feedback

Your work will be reviewed by other team members or maintainers. Be open to feedback and work collaboratively to address any suggestions or changes requested.

### 6. Merge and Recognition

Once your work is approved, it will be merged into the project. You'll receive recognition for your contribution, such as mentions in release notes or the project's contributors' list.
