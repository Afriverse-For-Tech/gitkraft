# Code Submission Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to ProjectCodex. We appreciate your interest in helping us achieve our mission of fostering collaboration among developers in Africa. Before you submit your code, please take a moment to review and follow these guidelines.

## Code Quality and Standards

1. **Coding Standards**: Please adhere to our coding standards and style guidelines. These guidelines include:

   - **Indentation**: Use [specific indentation style] (e.g., tabs/spaces).
   - **Code Structure**: Keep your code organized, well-documented, and easy to read.

2. **Documentation**: Include clear and concise inline comments that explain your code's purpose and any complex logic. If you're introducing new functionality, update the project's documentation accordingly.

3. **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for your code. Ensure that your changes don't break existing tests and that new features are properly covered.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide meaningful error messages.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you haven't already, fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/afriverse-for-tech/projectcodex) to your own GitHub account.

2. **Branching**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix from the latest `main` branch. Use a descriptive and meaningful branch name.

3. **Commits**: Make atomic commits with clear and descriptive commit messages. Each commit should have a single purpose.

4. **Code Review**: Submit a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/afriverse-for-tech/projectcodex). The PR should include:

   - A brief but informative title that summarizes the purpose of your changes.
   - A detailed description of what your changes accomplish.
   - Mention your team member ID (e.g., `Team ID: 123`) in your PR description.

5. **Review Process**: Your code will be reviewed by project maintainers and other contributors. Be prepared to address feedback and make necessary revisions. Be patient, as the review process may take some time.

6. **Merging**: Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch. Do not merge your own PR unless explicitly instructed.

## Team Member ID

To help us track your contributions and provide proper recognition, please mention your team member ID (e.g., `Team ID: 123`) when submitting your pull request. If you're not yet part of a team, join or create one in our Discord community and obtain your unique team member ID.

## Testing

Ensure that your changes pass all existing tests. If you introduce new features or modify existing functionality, write corresponding unit tests and ensure they pass.
